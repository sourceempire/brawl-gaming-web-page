            <h3>5. What does it mean to be a Data Controller?</h3>
            <p>A Data Controller is a legal person or other entity that determines the purpose and means for the processing of personal data.

        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>6. Brawl Gaming as a Data Controller</h3>
            <p>We, Source Empire AB (company reg. no. 559163-8175) are the Data Controller and therefor accountable in accordance with applicable legislation, for the processing that occurs with your personal data, within the scope of our services. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>7. Why are we allowed to process personal data?</h3>
            <p>7.1 For it to be permissible for us to process personal data there must always be support for said treatment within the GDPR, so-called lawful basis. Such lawful basis may include: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Consent from the Data Subject</li>
                    <li>That the processing of personal data is necessary to fulfill the terms of an agreement with the Data Subject, for example in relation to the use of the Brawl Gaming services</li>
                    <li>Fulfilling a legal obligation, for example storing certain information due to legislation regarding certain accounting standards and practices. This could also be the case when handling opt-out settings requests concerning your rights as a Data Subject in accordance with the GDPR.</li>
                    <li>A weighing of interests when we have a legitimate interest in using your data, for example for statistical purposes and to market our services, and to secure payment and prevent fraud.</li>
                </ul>

            7.2 It may occur that the same personal data is processed both when giving you support (fulfilling the terms of an agreement) as well as based on your consent or when fulfilling another legal obligation. This means, for example, that even though you may revoke your consent and the processing based on said consent ceases, that specific personal data may remain with us for separate reasons. All in all, as long as Brawl Gaming has a lawful basis for its processing of your personal data, Brawl Gaming reserves the right to proceed with said processing.</p>
